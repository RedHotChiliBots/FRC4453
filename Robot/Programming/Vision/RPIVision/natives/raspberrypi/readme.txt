These are precompiled JNI libraries for the raspberry pi.
These were built on a Raspberry Pi Zero running up-to-date Raspbian Jessie.

Libraries included are:
libntcore.so: NetworkTables
libopencv_java2413.so: OpenCV 2.4.13 JNI Library

All these libraries are compiled with debug info on, so they could be smaller. But, we would not get any useful debug info otherwise.
